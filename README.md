# Homechef (Meal Track Mobile App)
In this project, a cutting-edge meal tracking mobile application designed to streamline user's dietary habits and promote a healthier lifestyle. This innovative app, developed as a part of my school project, is a testament to the integration of agile methodology and advanced technologies like React Native, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Firebase.

## Key Features:

1. **Agile Methodology**:
Employing agile methodology allowed for a flexible and iterative development approach, ensuring rapid progress and timely adaptation to evolving requirements. This iterative process empowered efficient collaboration, seamless communication, and the ability to deliver a high-quality product.

1. **React Native & ReactJS**:
Leveraging the power of React Native and ReactJS, we crafted a seamless, cross-platform mobile application with a captivating and intuitive user interface. These technologies enabled us to optimize development time while delivering a consistent user experience across iOS and Android platforms.

1. **Firebase Integration**:
Central to our app is Firebase, a robust and real-time database solution that facilitated seamless data storage, retrieval, and synchronization. Firebase's real-time capabilities ensure users always have access to the most up-to-date meal information and personalized recommendations.

1. **Node & Expo**:
The app's development was bolstered by Node.js and Expo. Node.js, with its efficient and scalable back-end capabilities, combined with Expo's rapid prototyping and development environment, ensured a smooth and accelerated app creation process.
